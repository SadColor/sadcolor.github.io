<a class="collapse" role="button">Second prototype, more surface stuff</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>So I had a decently long break from programming the first prototype. I programmed a couple Ludum Dare entries, and at some point I switched over to GMS2. By the way, it's so much nicer to work in than GMS1, for real. Anyways, armed with newfound programming insight, I made a lot of improvements. Or maybe I didn't. Let's find out together!</p>
		<p>Well, before that, let's get some easy stuff out of the way. The resolution of the game is now 1024×576. Again, another odd 16:9 resolution. I still have no clue why I didn't just go 720p. Also, the HUD is basically totally complete. I had the idea of what I wanted to do and I figured it would be pretty easy, so I just knocked it out early on. Also, this time I was drawing placeholder sketches instead of using a placeholder character. I guess I thought it might motivate my dev process somewhat since I could operate on a draw→implement move→draw→implement move cycle. Looks like it didn't work. Oops.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">General improvements</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>So, one thing that improved over the previous prototype is that I started making use of GMS's "Begin Step" and "End Step" events. "Steps" in GameMaker are just frames, basically. So using code that triggers on these events is useful for guaranteeing execution order. For example, I would make sure that collision detection and stuff like that happens at the end of a step, after characters have already performed their actions for each frame.</p>
		<p>Another thing that improved is that I started using macros and enums way more. I still haven't really decided how much familiarity I'm assuming on the part of the reader when it comes to programming or GameMaker, so I guess I'll (poorly) explain what those are just in case. Uh, I guess I can put it in a collapsible thing so you can skip it more easily if you want.</p>
		<div class="dropdown">
			<p>Often when programming, there are set values that you want to use throughout the program. However, hard-coding values is often a bad idea, because it will be hard to change down the line, and because it forces people working on the code to remember "magic numbers" when dealing with certain parts of the code. For a simple example, take the max HP value of characters. Right now, the "average" HP amount is 1000, and other characters vary from that in multiples of 50. But maybe when I've made a few characters, it turns out that everyone's damage is way too high, and I actually want the average to be like, 1250 or 1500. If I just wrote a standard line like "maxHP = 1000" for everyone, I'd have to go in and change every character's HP value manually. However, if I use a macro called AVERAGE_HP, then I can just change the value of the macro and, since every characters' max HP uses AVERAGE_HP, their max HP values will all change too.</p>
			<p>It's different than a variable because it doesn't take up any space in memory, so it can't really be changed. Instead, it's basically "baked in" to the code during the compilation process. You can kind of think of it like, well, a webpage vs. a screenshot of a webpage. The screenshot represents a fixed point in time, so it will always be the same. But if you visit a webpage, its contents can be changed at any time. This is the simplest use case of macros, but since they're effectively like "find-and-replace" functions, you can actually write macros that work almost exactly like a function. I haven't done that yet, though.</p>
			<p>Also super useful are <b>enums</b>, which are kind of like a multiple-choice macro. Part of the reason these are useful is because (like macros) they're changed into hard-coded values, so they don't eat up extra space in memory once the final program is made. Just like macros, you can use them in places where you would want hard-coded values.</p>
			<p>If you think about a boolean (true-false) value, you can represent it with just a 0 or 1 since there are only two options. However, in GameMaker every variable is a 64-bit number (if I recall correctly). Instead of making a bunch of separate variables that take up a lot of space, you can condense a series of boolean values into one larger number where each digit represents a specific on-off value. If I did this without using enums, I would have a bunch of "magic numbers" all over my code that don't make any sense and become impossible to read without referencing something that tells you what every digit means. Enums solve that problem because they have names, obviously. I use this stuff all the time so it really made it way easier to program and scan over my code later.</p>

		<p>Collision handling is basically the same as the first prototype. There are some minor improvements to the internal structure of the hit/hurtbox objects themselves, but they're still based around recreating/destroying objects over and over and hitboxes and hurtboxes are still completely separate without even a parent object.</p>

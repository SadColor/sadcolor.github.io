	<h3>Mobility options</h3>
	<div class="chat">
		<p>
		<b>Dash</b>: Double-tap forward or press {{ D }} to start running forwards. You'll run as long as you hold forward or {{ D }}. You can cancel a dash into a crouch or block, or you can do dashing normals by pressing {{ B }} or {{ C }} during a dash. <br/>
		Dash normals can't be chained into other normals, but can still cancel into Skills.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Backstep</b>: Double-tap back or press {{ 4 }}{{ D }} to quickly step a short distance backwards. There is a small amount of invincibility at the start of a backstep.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Hop</b>: Press {{ 6 }}{{ S }} to perform a short jump forwards. It lets you perform aerial attacks faster than a normal jump, but doesn't avoid grounded attacks as well. You can't chain or special cancel moves from a hop.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Super Jump</b>: Quickly press down and then a jumping direction to perform a larger jump upwards.
		</p>
		{{ cornerR }}

	<h3>Super Block</h3>
	<div class="chat">
		<p>You can press {{ S }} while holding the stick in a blocking direction to perform a Super Block.<br/>
		Successfully Super Blocking an attack will reduce blockstun and pushback, nullify chip damage, and give you extra SP and TP.<br/>
		Additionally, Super Block is the only way to block some air-unblockable attacks.<br/>
		Don't throw it out recklessly! Super Blocking locks you into an animation for a short period of time, leaving you vulnerable to throws or lows/overheads if you were blocking the wrong way.</p>
		{{ cornerR }}
	</div>
	
	<h3>Parry</h3>
	<div class="chat">
		<p>Tap forward or down from a neutral position to initiate a <t-r>parry</t-r> attempt. This doesn't have an animation, but you will be locked out of parrying for a short amount of time afterwards.<br/>
		If an attack connects within a short time of you tapping the proper direction, you will nullify all damage from the attack and be able to act before the opponent.<br/>
		You can also perform a <t-r>red parry</t-r> by parrying in the middle of a blockstring. The timing is much tighter and failing it will cause you to get hit by the attack you were attempting to parry, so be careful.<br/>
		Parrying prevents the opponent from chaining into normals, jump-canceling, and dash-canceling. However, they can still perform other cancels when applicable (like normal→Skill or Skill→EX Skill).</p>
		{{ cornerR }}
	</div>
	
	<h3>Burst</h3>
	<div class="chat">
		<p>
		When the Burst meter is full, you can press {{ A }}{{ B }}{{ C }}{{ S }} during hitstun or blockstun to interrupt and perform a burst that knocks the opponent away if it hits.<br/>
		The Burst meter refills from empty to full in about 60 - 80 seconds. The refill rate increases as your health gets lower. A successful connect recovers 30% of your Burst meter.<br/>
		Burst startup is only vulnerable to <t-g><b>GRAB</b></t-g>s, and the recovery of a burst is a counterhit state.

	<div class="chatS movelist">
		<p>This post is like a really general and rambly overview of my history with wanting to make a fighting game. It's not super exciting and there won't be any pictures or anything, so you really don't have to read this one.<br/>
		
	</div>

	<h3 id="sec1"><a class="collapse" role="button">Before this prototype...</a></h3>
	<div class="chatS movelist">
		<p>So, for actually a pretty long time, I've been wanting to make a fighting game of some variety.<br/>
		Sometime in middle school, I had gotten into Street Fighter 2 a little bit (even though I had been playing Smash for way longer at that point), and I drew up a tiny moveset for a few of my characters. One was a lot like ST Chun-Li, one was a lot like A2 Sakura, and one was... original, I guess.<br/>
		I had some really cursed motions for some of the moves! Ever wanted to input <b>236982</b> (that's a half-circle up, then down) to do a fireball? I sure hope not. There was also <b>[2]896</b> for some weird overhead kick, <b>[2]14623</b> for one character's super, <b>2362362</b> for one character's DP (?!), or <b>632142236</b> for that same character's super. I have no clue what I was thinking back then.</p>
		
		<p>Anyways, in late middle school/early high school I got super into Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Uh, important to note, I never played UMvC3 until way later when the PC port came out about when I was graduating high school. So really my only knowledge about the game was just watching high-level play and reading descriptions of the game mechanics on Shoryuken Wiki and stuff.<br/>
		So throughout in that time I was drawing movesets for a bunch of my characters on graph paper. They were based on UMvC3's mechanics (chaining only works from light to heavy; there are three attack buttons L, M, H, and a launcher button S; and so on).<br/>
		Something different from UMvC3 is that I was going to have a crouching S for every character. If you've played Guilty Gear, you might expect that crouching S would be a universal sweep (low move that knocks down) or something. Actually, it was just another launcher. Why...? I have no idea. A lot of character movesets I drew at that time didn't even have a sweep, which is something unthinkable for me now. I guess when it's a Marvel-style game, you don't really need a sweep anyways since you almost always get knockdowns from other stuff like launcher into finisher or Hyper Combos or whatever.</p>
		
		<p>I had a few different iterations of game ideas, though they all shared that control scheme (and none of them fixed the crouching S redundancy! It seriously bugs me...). Another common theme with all of them is that special move motions were still weird. They weren't like, cursed, but I would still do things like have a character have two Z-motions and a half-circle motion, even though they don't have a single quarter circle special move. Of course, nowadays I try sticking to simple motions (quarter-circles and sometimes DP motions) all the time.<br/>
		Anyways, I think that's about all I have to say about the paper era of my fighting game ideas, so let's move on.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sec2"><a class="collapse" role="button">Still before this prototype: a Google Doc or two</a></h3>
	<div class="chatS movelist">
		<p>Near the end of my high school... career? I don't know what you'd call it. Wait, maybe I should rephrase.<br/>
		In the latter half of my last year of high school, I started working on movesets in a different form: as a Google Doc!<br/>
		It was obviously a lot faster to add, remove, or otherwise edit things than drawing on a physical piece of paper. Plus, it was an opportunity to clearly spell out what kind of mechanics I wanted in my game! Spoiler alert: it was basically UMvC3. The only significant difference from UMvC3 is that you would be able to do EX special moves with the S button, costing 1/2 of a Hyper Meter level. <br/>
		Oh, another thing I was going to have was that there would be a "simple input" mode where you could do specials with a direction and a button, like Smash or something. There were a lot of weird restrictions that were going to be on it to not make it more effective than normal motions, but they were totally arbitrary and weird. Like, for example, there was going to be a small input buffer because by that point I had played SF4 and thought 1-frame links were annoying. But if you played on easy mode, there wouldn't be a link buffer anymore. Sure, why not...</p>
		
		<p>A theme with a lot of my older movesets is that there wasn't a lot of thought put into the moves of characters. By this point, I think I had a little bit of a better idea, even if it was because I was taking heavy heavy inspiration from other characters. Like, a previous version of one of my character had two anti-air specials, but no fireball or anything (well, they did have some kind of projectile if you wanted to do TK DP motion, but it wasn't going to be fast enough to work as a fireball and anti-air kind of game). In this version, they have a normal fireball and an anti-air, so that's a good start. And they also have an anti-projectile special and an actual mixup in the form of a rekka! Whether or not it would coaslesce into a good character, at least they have moves with distinct purposes.<br/>
		Actually, I still kind of worry about this sort of thing now, but I've just accepted with my current level of knowledge that I'll have no idea whether or not a character's tools work well together until I actually make the goddamn game. At least, I try to give normals and specials their own purpose rather than just jotting down random stuff.</p>
		
		<p>Anyways, I only worked on about 3 characters in that doc before I decided to change gears a little bit. See, by that point I'd come to think that the -isms in SFA3 and grooves in CvS2 were sick as hell, actually, and I wanna do that too! Eventually.<br/>
		So it's important to note that, besides the addition of grooves, the controls and moves and everything are still basically the same. I tweaked the existing characters a little bit, and I added quite a few more new ones. We're still operating under UMvC3's combo mechanics of launcher and finisher, specific OTG moves, hard and soft knockdowns, and so on. It's not a team fighter anymore, though.<br/>
		Oh, one other thing: I removed the weird penalties I mentioned earlier for the simple input mode. There were still downsides (like your special moves would be kind of delayed because it used a short press for the light special and a long press for heavy special), but they were just more like inherent flaws of the system. I think it was the best I could do without requiring weird button combinations (even then, I was trying to be pad-friendly and control-layout-agnostic).
		
		<p>As for the grooves, three of them were based on three different Street Fighter games, pretty much.<br/>
		There was a 3rd Strike groove that had parry, red parry, variable meter depending on your Super Art, and stuff.<br/>
		There was a V-ism groove that had custom combos, guard bar, Alpha Counter, and the CvS2 thing where you could end 100% custom combos with a super.<br/>
		There was a SF4 groove that had Focus Attack, and a separate EX/Ultra meter.<br/>
		There were a couple of slightly more original ones. There was one that was kind of like Hakumen's meter system, but not as cool. Also, for some reason I slapped Garou's T.O.P. system on there (power up when you're within a certain health range). Dunno why really. There was also one that was more like KOF games, so it had roll, guard cancel roll, and shorthops. It also had Baroque Cancel from TvC. Cool?</p>
		
		<p>Something that started here that I've kept since is a system of recoverable damage. It's pretty standard in team fighting games where you can switch characters that some of the damage you take can be gradually recovered if you swap that character out (but it's usually lost if you tag them back in or if they are made to be tagged in). But in the switch from a team game to a 1v1 game, I didn't abandon the idea of recoverable health. I basically used the recoverable health system from Vampire Savior from that point on. I can't remember if I was inspired by something else, but another change I made was that throws would delete your recoverable health, which I don't think was in V-Sav.<br/>
		Let's move on now.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sec3"><a class="collapse" role="button">Doc versions 3 and 4</a></h3>
	<div class="chatS movelist">
		<p>Side note: the programming of the first prototype seems to take place during the second version of the doc, and the second prototype was programmed during the third version.</p>
		
		<p>Anyways, so eventually I moved on to the third version of this doc. No more grooves, that was way too much and I didn't really have good perspective for what would work. The main thing that's in this document is that now there's Burst and Roman Cancels from Guilty Gear XRD. Actually a good thing to just blatantly copy, I suppose.</br>
		Another major change is that I finally broke away from the UMvC3 control scheme, sort of. The launcher→finisher system is still in the game, but it's not dedicated to the S button anymore (although, usually <b>j.S</b> is the finisher for every character). Instead, <b>S</b> is more like the Drive button in BlazBlue, kinda, where it's supposed to be like unique moves that illustrate the character's main mechanic (or if they didn't really have a mechanic, just some kind of unique move, right...). But also it's still like the Guilty Gear Dust button because <b>2S</b> is the universal sweep. Seems kind of weird when I repurposed the button to basically be a special move button, but whatever.<br/>
		Eventually I also changed it to be a version 4. Unlike the other version changes, there wasn't really any significant mechanical or design philosophy change or anything. I think that it was just because by that point, I was sometimes editing the doc during college classes on an Android tablet, but it would run pretty slowly and making a copy of the document (which cleared the edit history) sped it up a little.</p>

	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sec4"><a class="collapse" role="button">Doc versions 4.1 and 4.2: the good ones (finally)</a></h3>
	<div class="chatS movelist">
		<p>So by the time I decided to make the "4.1" version of my doc (which is a way larger change than v4 was, but we'll get to that), I had played a ton more fighting games, especially Guilty Gear and Under Night In-Birth. And so eventually, I decided that I wanted to give my FG idea an overhaul. A very, very, Under-Night-flavored overhaul.</p>
		<p>So I gave the doc a spiffy new dark mode color scheme, and also I switched to using <b>A B C</b> instead of <b>L M H</b>.</p>
		<p>Okay, besides that aesthetic stuff, the gameplay features changed a lot. Importantly, the normal chaining system has changed from UMvC3's ascending style (can only go from a lower-strength normal to a higher-strength normal) to the freeform system of UNI (where you can chain normals together however you want, as long as you only use them once per chain). Seriously, UNI's combo system is fun as hell and it's one of my favorite things in a fighting game ever. Also, the <b>S</b> button is gone, but there is a <b>D</b> button (again, functions like UNI's <b>D</b> button in that it's the way you use all the system mechanics like Shield and Assault). Also, you now have another way to use your burst meter in the form of Overdrive (works like BlazBlue, more or less).</p>
		<p>Anyways, around about here is when I really started thinking about like, the coverage that my characters' moves are giving. Like, what moves would be good anti-airs, what ones are safe on block, what ones are used for mixups or are plus on block, or what ones are good for combos, whether they're supposed to be generally good or only in specific situations, so on and so on. So, overall I feel like my design now is way more solid than even the previous v4.</p>
		<p>The 4.2 version isn't super special though. It's got some minor aesthetic upgrades, but the <b>S</b> button has now returned. It again serves the purpose of being a sort of unique character move, or the vehicle for their mechanic if they have one. It also serves a secondary purpose of simplifying or offloading certain button combinations, which is nice.</p>
		<p>This version of the doc and the FG I'm making with Bug Fables characters are coming from pretty much the same point design-wise. And that's all I feel like writing for this post, sooooo... bye.</p>

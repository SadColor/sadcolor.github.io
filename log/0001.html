	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>WIP post</p>
		<p>Something I feel like is really important in in fighting games is the existence of "tricks", whether intentional or unintentional.<br/>
		I don't have a solid definition for what a "trick" is, but I feel like it's just something that's creative and can be used in a free-form manner.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">Examples of "tricks"</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>In Melty Blood (haven't played) and UNIB (have played a ton of), their chaining system lets you "reverse beat" by going from a heavy normal like C into a lighter normal like B or A. It opens up things like making your moves safer or even plus by chaining back into an A normal, or doing anti-air and using a reverse beat as a confirm window to do the rest of the combo, or even using whiffed normals in the middle of certain combos. The immediate implications of this are accounted for in the game design, but I think some of the things you can do with it were probably figured out later.</p>
		<p>Another thing that's a "trick" for me is C. Viper's feints in SF4/MvC3. They kind of act as a different way to create frametraps on block by canceling a normal into a feint. They can also open up new combo routes that are executionally more difficult, but more rewarding. And in MvC3, you can feint her Burn Kick, which lets you alter her aerial momentum because the beginning of Burn Kick is a short hop upwards (and there are cool aerial combos you can do with Burn Kick feints, too).</p>
		<p>In Melee, I think the "trick" is really just the game's incredibly flexible movement system. I didn't really keep up with SSB4 or Ultimate so I don't know if they have anything that cool. In those games, it's usually the stuff that people would call "jank" that I think is cool...</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">Contrast with Street Fighter</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>A lot of these tricks are found in anime fighters, which overall have a reputation for being more complex. I think Street Fighter games have a lack of a lot of complexity or depth that would make it more interesting for me to play or watch.</p>
		<p>SF3 is definitely the best, since it has the parry mechanic that makes every interaction have a lot more depth just because of how parries can factor in to every single situation. It's kind of like why I like GRD in UNIB, because it colors a lot of decisions in the game (do you do a shorter combo to get time to concentrate and gain GRD? do you try to go for a throw to take away the opponent's GRD? are you going to shield to gain GRD and risk being GRD broken by a grab? and so on). Also, SF3 is kind of old, so there's the usual jank that's been converted into cool tech that you see every so often.</p>
		<p>SF4 and SF5 don't really have anything like that. But I still think SF4 is more interesting, because the character design is more varied. Zoning is a lot stronger, but rushdown characters are also strong. And grapplers are... grapplers. But also, they still have some cool things, like how Ken can throw kara-fireballs to advance forwards slightly when he throws fireballs. Or C. Viper, like I mentioned before. And there are other things, but I'm not super knowledgeable about SF4 so whatever.</p>
		<p>SF5 is just... boring to watch, in my opinion. I guess I don't have to say "in my opinion" because this is literally my blog thingy, but whatever. Anyways, I just feel like every character plays so similarly. The neutral is fine, though a little bland because it's lacking "tricks" to me. There just aren't many characters that have an especially unique way of playing neutral, I think. And that's even worse for their up close game. Most characters, when they get in, just run strike/throw and that's <b>it</b>. They have a frametrap (usually medium→medium, or sometimes light→medium if you're playing against a character with a 3 frame normal), and they either do the frametrap on block or they throw you. Most characters don't even have a variation on how to play strike/throw. Like, Karin can use her command dash to get in from further than normal in a blockstring and still throw you if the opponent isn't ready to check her. Menat's pressure can get more varied when her orb is already out and she can recall it (and it even gives her a decent low/overhead mixup, which is sorely missing from SF5). Poison has stance cancels which, like C. Viper, are pretty neat.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">Dark Gimmick!</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>Unlike the ROM hacks before, Dark Gimmick aims to be a more difficult hack, and pretty extensively changes levels.</p>
		
		<p><b>Concluding thoughts</b></p>
		<p>I'd say it's not bad. I think it succeeds at being a harder version of Gimmick that's still pretty fun, but some aspects of the level design are really annoying (partially due to engine limitations). It still seems like it might be fun to try to complete a run of at some point, though.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">Gimmick! 2</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>This game is styled as a sequel of sorts to Gimmick. It's got a slightly edited intro, and for some reason it's a patch for the unreleased USA prototype, which mean that it doesn't have the sound expansion present in the Japanese version, so the music has received a slight downgrade and the sound effects also overwrite the music much more prominently. Awesome. Let's take a look at the game.</p>

		<p>-</p>
		
		<p><b>Concluding thoughts</b></p>
		<p>Maybe the worst hack here? None of the new levels are great, there's a lot of weird glitchiness, and it even shoplifts some level designs from Dark Gimmick.</p>

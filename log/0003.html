		<p>So recently, a frend and I watched the Persona 3 films together. And they kinda sucked big time.<br>
		Before I get into the details, just a couple things:<br>
		One is that, obviously, this will have spoilers for Persona 3 and its film adaptation.<br>
		And the other thing is that I haven't experienced any of the original Persona 3 (or FES) past the part where Fuuka joins the party.<br>
		With that out of the way, let's have an unproductive bashing session! Or maybe it will be productive, who knows.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">The Protagonist</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>Every single movie has a huge pacing problem, I think. This is due to a lot of factors that I'll try to recall right now.<br>
		One of the biggest reasons is that they decided to give the protagonist a character arc in each film. Not just one film, but all of them. While I get why they would want to do that, the main character never really goes through a character arc in any Persona game, because you play as them. This means that they're adding extra content that they have to try to work into the story on top of whatever other things they're keeping from an 80-hour (or whatever) JRPG.<br>
		It's also not even necessary to really do that. The function of the protagonist in the Persona games is often to act as a mirror for other characters to bounce their ideas off of, allowing them to overcome personal hurdles and grow as people. In fact, the lack of focus on the development of other characters and how they interact is another huge weak point of the movies, but I'll talk about that in just a second.</p>
		<p>Another problem is the specific way that the protagonist's character development is written. While characters explaining aspects of your personality and changes is pretty common in Persona games (since you play as a silent protagonist), they carry that over to the movie where they tried to give him like, a real personality and thought process. However, they still don't really explore that personality in any real detail. The only good moment of character building I remember is how he is introduced as not holding any value for his life, but becomes afraid for other people's lives. That's basically the start of the first movie! Instead, the protagonist comes off as ridiculously suggestible, as every other arc he has in the movies is when a character tells him something and he meditates on it for the entire film. Examples of this are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>• Jin tells SEES about how ending the Dark Hour means going back to their ordinary lives. The rest of the movie deals with this conflict.
		<li>• Pharos telling the protagonist that it's better to never connect with people, because you might lose them. The rest of the movie deals with this conflict.
		</ul>
		<p>Actually, I kind of forgot if there were any other major moments for the protagonist in the first and last movie, so... oops.<br>
		Anyways, the first thing I listed there is completely egregious. After Jin tells SEES that, Makoto becomes really hesitant because he doesn't want the Dark Hour to end. In fact, that specific line is shown in multiple flashbacks. This is despite the fact that over the course of the rest of the film, we learn that Fuuka and Aigis both believe that their existence has no purpose without the Dark Hour. And yet, they never get brought up whenever we see the protagonist hung up about the Dark Hour.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">The Other Characters</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>Another huge problem that contributes to pacing problems, among other problems, is the real lack of focus on character relationships. The heart of the Persona series is character interaction and how bonding with others makes you stronger, lets you see the world from a different perspective, teaches you new things, and so on. And the movie totally misses this.</p>
		<p>Barely any time is spent on how characters bounce off of each other, which makes most of the interpersonal conflict feel very out-of-nowhere. The most developed relationship is probably between Ken and Shinjiro. Of course, they had to do this because Shinjiro is integral to Ken's reason for being in SEES and because otherwise Shinjiro's death means nothing.</p>
		<p>Next is maybe Junpei and Chidori's relationship. It's more or less fine I guess, but it's still presented in a strange order. Like, I think we see like 10 seconds of Junpei and Chidori in the second film, then the third film starts with SEES fighting Strega and Junpei has been kidnapped by her? And then the rest of the movie builds the relationship partly through present-day moments and partly through flashbacks (which feel like they would have made more sense to put earlier, but otherwise it's fine since they're kind of the main focus of the movie).</p>
		<p>The next most-developed interpersonal relationship #drama moment is like, Yukari getting mad at the protagonist in the first movie, and that is not well developed at all. It still feels like it comes out of nowhere when Yukari snaps at him, even though we do see some of the issues between their personalities.</p>
		<p>And in general, there are just a lot of other moments of character conflict that feel weird because we don't get a lot of insight into each character's personality or way of thinking. Also, the lack of focus on other characters means that we get stuff like Fuuka in the second movie talking about how she has no purpose outside of SEES, and as far as I remember that doesn't get resolved on-screen at all. And, as stated earlier, the conflict about ending the Dark Hour in that movie is framed around Jin taunting the protagonist with his formerly ordinary life, rather than the psychological issues other SEES members are going through.</p>
		<p>It just sucks a lot of the life out of the movies, especially when they dedicate time to the protagonist's terribly-written character arcs or battles that aren't super plot-relevant (like the one they open the second movie on, which also kills time with dumb fanservice shots that are even worse because the characters are high schoolers).</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">The Art</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>Even the art is worse than the original game. I don't mean by like the standards of the portraits, I mean the animated cutscenes from the original game are sometimes way better than the equivalent scenes in the movie (granted, there aren't too many animated cutscenes in the game anyways).</p>
		<p>One thing about the movie's art style is that it has a lot of the characteristics of other modern digital anime. Like, it kinda has a really standard color palette, and at different times of day (sunset, nighttime, Dark Hour), the colors look like the same colors but with an overlay put on them. This is something I really dislike about modern anime, because back in the days of cel animation, you had to pick specific colors for different times of day and lighting and such, which made it way more stylized and expressive.</p>
		<!-- examples -->
		<p>That point about cel animation was kind of a tangent because I don't know if the P3 game uses cel animation, but what I mean to say is that I think the original P3 <b>does</b> pick unique colors for those different times of day (or at least, uses its overlays more smartly). So like, in the movies, the Dark Hour kind of looks like they put a dark greenish overlay over everything. In the game, the characters' colors are still bright, but with very dark shading. In a way, it almost looks like an overexposed photo.</p>
		<!-- examples -->
		<p>Also, in general, the P3 game's art style has a lot less full shading and sometimes doesn't have it at all! To be honest, it's mostly preference, but I think the look of the minimal shading and flat-colored look is way cooler. It's certainly more unique than the shading style of the movies, in any case.</p>
		<!-- examples -->
		<p>Okay, but besides the coloring stuff, I also think the way the characters are drawn in general is just better, mostly in the face area. Again, it's personal preference, but I feel like the game's art style is just more pleasant when it comes to the face area. I can't really explain why, but I think one aspect I like more is just that their facial proportions are a little more age-appropriate, I feel like. The movie makes everyone look a little bit older by comparison.</p>
		<p>While it's not necessarily always a good thing, and it's probably caused partially by budget constraints, the original P3 also has a lot more interesting directing choices. There's a lot more closeups on people's expressions, or parts of the body that are performing an action, or like weird slanted and cut-off angles. I think shots like these are interesting, but they're lacking from the movies.</p>
		<!-- examples -->
		<p>One really cool example is Shinjiro's death scene. It's handled in a really artful way in the original game, I think, but the movie is just kind of standard and boring.</p>
		<!-- comparison -->
		<p>Also, the biggest sin: the protagonist never spins their gun around in a cool way like he does in the game when he summons a Persona >:(.</p>

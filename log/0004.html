		<p>WIP post</p>
		<p>This is just a post gushing about my favorite mechanic of all time, the GRD systemm in the Under Night In-Birth series. Let's find out why I think it's cool!</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">What is GRD?</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>GRD is often described as a "tug of war" system. Certain actions (usually aggressive or offensive ones) will increase your GRD, while others (usually passive or defensive) will reduce it. The amount of GRD you have won't do anything on its own, but there is also a timer that cycles every 16 seconds that will award a status called Vorpal. This gives you a 10% damage buff and improves various properties about your character, depending on the character. Usually the biggest thing is that a player in Vorpal has access to Chain Shift, which is basically a Roman Cancel that freezes the screen and consumes your GRD to give you meter.</p>
		<p>Another facet of the GRD system is the ability to be "GRD broken". When you guard high/low incorrectly, get thrown while Shielding, or try to Shield an air-unblockable attack, you lose access to Shielding (a very useful defensive tool), and can't win the GRD cycle at all.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">#2: It adds combo depth</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>Combo depth is something that a lot of fighting games can struggle with, I feel like. I think it's fun when games have lots of viable options for combo routes that aren't just about skill level (although obviously it's good if there are different combos for different skill levels). The usual factors in deciding a combo route are stuff like whether you started with a light normal, how high the opponent is if you get an anti-air, whether or not you get a counter hit, whether you want to go for damage or okizeme (or dizzy, if the game has that), and so on. In my experience, most fighting games usually have one go-to route for a given scenario, which opens a little more up if you have meter.</p>
		<p>GRD is cool because it gives combos a lot of variables at any given time. Doing a long combo slowly gives your opponent GRD, so you might opt for a shorter combo, especially when the GRD timer is about to cycle. Using a Force Function (a unique move for each character) costs GRD, but usually gives you more damaging combos, so you might opt to save GRD or expend it depending on a variety of factors (opponent health, relative GRD amounts, GRD cycle timing).</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">#3: It adds defensive depth</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>Defending in fighting games usually isn't super complicated. Every fighting game has the usual strike/throw mixup stuff, and some games give you funny options while defending like Just Defends or parries or push-blocks or what have you. And UNI does have a sorta-instant block system in the form of Shielding.</p>
		<p>Shielding attacks gives you GRD, drains the opponents GRD, and depending on whether you did it in neutral or blockstun, some other things. Those other things aren't really relevant right now. This means that the act of defending can be a turning point in momentum, because Shielding the right attacks can give you enough GRD to win Vorpal, which is really helpful for defensive situations since it gives you Chain Shift.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, the existence of Shielding makes the usual strike/throw mixup more layered. If you get thrown or incorrectly block high/low while Shielding, you get GRD-broken, which means you can't win the GRD cycle and don't have access to Shield anymore. This has huge implications for offense, as a lot of blockstrings are much harder to deal with when you can't Shield to push the opponent away. So reading your opponent's Shield habits is crucial to enabling offense.</p>
		<p>Additionally, throws give the thrower GRD and remove GRD from the opponent. This makes throws a useful way to quickly gain GRD, but they also contain an element of risk as having your throw teched will have the opposite effect on GRD. So your throw timing also depends on GRD amounts and the timing of the GRD cycle. Throws might become more common near the end of the GRD cycle to try to win it quickly, but that also makes throw baits a powerful option at that moment.</p>

<a class="collapse" role="button">#4: It adds another purpose to some attacks</a></h3>
	<div class="chat movelist">
		<p>Certain moves have extra utility compared to other fighting games thanks to GRD. For example, hard knockdown moves are obviously useful because they let you get better okizeme, even from further away. However, it's also useful in UNI because it allows you to use the knockdown time to charge up your GRD. You can charge it a little and still get some oki, or sacrifice oki to get even more GRD (more effective the further away your opponent is).</p>
		<p>Another class of moves that gets enhanced are moves that don't knock down as a combo ender, or knock the opponent far away. In other games, these are usually restricted to quick moves that work even from light normals or very scaled combos, but sacrifice your ability to apply okizeme (unless you're in the corner). These moves are given midscreen utility by allowing you to knock the opponent far away to charge GRD. This is usually most useful near the end of the GRD cycle when both players have similar amounts of GRD, allowing you to nudge the balance in your favor just enough to win the cycle.</p>

<p>Hiya! I'm actually filling this one in later, since I felt like it'd be a good thing to cover before anything else.<br/>
Let's learn how to actually pronounce Japanese words! Or rather, let's learn some quirks about Japanese pronunciation, I guess.

<h3>Vowel sounds</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogR"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_neutral.png"/></div>
<p>Japanese has a more limited set of sounds than English, but that doesn't make it easy to pronounce for English speakers. But let's start with the easiest part: vowel sounds.<br/>
In Japanese, there are only five vowel sounds: あ, い, う, え, and お. Here are some approximations that I think are more or less right.<br/>
<t-r>あ</t-r> is pronounced "ah" like the sound in "bra".<br/>
<t-r>い</t-r> is pronounced "ee" like the sound in "tee".<br/>
<t-r>う</t-r> is pronounced "oo" like the sound in "who".<br/>
<t-r>え</t-r> is pronounced "eh" like the sound in "set".<br/>
<t-r>お</t-r> is pronounced "oh" like the sound in "go".<br/>
I think the あ sound is just slightly different than any English word I can think of off the top of my head, so you might wanna look that one up. Otherwise, the rest should be more or less the same.<br/>
There are still a couple other things that are different than English. One is that you <t-r>don't really round your lips</t-r> when speaking in Japanese, even though you do in English sometimes (like pronouncing O and U). This changes how certain sounds... sound, slightly.<br/>
Also, for some reason English doesn't actually have a monophthong O sound? As it turns out, basically all the time you say an O sound in English, it's actually a diphthong. And I think the place in the mouth you say it from is just different? So like, actually, maybe go look up the O sound too. Sorry.<br/>
It's also important to learn how to pronounce <t-r>long vowels</t-r>. They kind of sound like stress in English (compare how long you say each vowel sound in とい, とおい, and といい). But besides that, there are a <t-r>couple of exceptions</t-r> to the normally pretty regular Japanese spelling.<br/>
<t-r>おう is pronounced the same as おお</t-r> and <t-r>えい is usually pronounced like ええ</t-r>.<br/>
Anyway's, let's move on.

<h3>Dropped sounds</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogL"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_think.png"/></div>
<p>In speech, <t-r>the い and う sounds are often not as clearly vocalized</t-r> as if you were speaking "properly".<br/>
They're both dropped pretty often when put between two voiceless consonants.<br/>
For example, <ruby>月<rt>つき</rt></ruby> would be romanized "tsuki", but when spoken it can almost sound like "ts-ki", with the う sound becoming very quiet.<br/>
Other examples are <ruby>地下鉄<rt>ちかてつ</rt></ruby> "chikatetsu" sounding like "ch-katetsu", or <ruby>意識<rt>いしき</rt></ruby> "ishiki" sounding like "ish-ki".<br/>
They're also often dropped at the end of words (again, after voiceless consonants), most commonly です sounding like "des" rather than "desu".<br/>
If you play, say, Puyo Puyo Champions in Japanese, you can hear how some characters will say <ruby>一<rt>いち</rt></ruby>, <ruby>六<rt>ろく</rt></ruby>, or <ruby>八<rt>はち</rt></ruby> with a clearly pronounced final vowel sound, while others don't.<br/>
It's not exactly necessary to learn to speak this way, but I think it's pretty natural when you start trying to say words faster (since it's easier). It's good to keep in mind for listening to speech.

<h3>The F sound</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogR"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_kossori.png"/></div>
<p>The F sound (only found in the ふ kana and youon that use it) in Japanese is a lot softer of a sound than in English. In fact, pronouncing it is actually <t-r>very different</t-r>.<br/>
In English, when you make an F sound, you put your bottom lip under your teeth and blow air through your lips and teeth. However, in Japanese, the F sound is made by just blowing air through your lips, without your teeth touching.

<h3>That darn R sound</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogL"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_think.png"/></div>
<p>A pretty well-known fact about Japanese is that <t-r>there is no distinction between R and L</t-r>. The sound is usually romanized as an R, and can be described as a mix of L, R, and D, which is pretty sounds weird at first.<br/>
To pronounce the Japanese R, you have to touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth, right behind your teeth.<br/>
It's <t-r>really similar to what you do when you roll an R</t-r>, except you just do it once instead of keeping your tongue against your teeth (I think that's called a flap...?).<br/>
If it helps, <a href="https://youtu.be/V2wzUuGm7yw?t=74">here</a> is a Tofugu video about pronouncing the Japanese R sound.

<h3>The W sound</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogR"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_neutral.png"/></div>
<p>There's not a lot to say about the W sound, really. But I want to point out that the W sound is a pretty weakly-pronounced consonant. Just like vowels, you <t-r>don't really round your lips</t-r> when saying the W sound, even though you would in English. If you say a word like <ruby>川<rt>かわ</rt></ruby>, <t-r>your lips should hardly move</t-r> from the position they make when saying the あ sound.<br/>
Consequently, you might hear words like <ruby>回<rt>まわ</rt></ruby>る pronounced like "まある".<br/>

</div>

<h3>The ん kana</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogL"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_kossori.png"/></div>
<p>You might have thought that there wasn't a lot to the sound of ん. It's just an N, right?<br/>
However, the pronunciation of it changes slightly in certain contexts.<br/>
Most of the time, you can pronounce it as just an N. However, before certain consonants, it ends up sounding more like an M. It can sound like an "ng" before a G sound. And of course, there's the question of how you pronounce んあ and んや differently than な and にゃ.<br/>
Personally, I try to make the same sound as a normal English N, but <t-r>without putting my tongue at the roof of my mouth</t-r>. I find that if I do this, I tend to end up making the right N sound since my tongue will naturally go to the right spot according to the following sound.<br/>
If you try to say something like <ruby>千円<rt>せんえん</rt></ruby>, it can even sound like you're putting a Y sound before the え in <ruby>円<rt>えん</rt></ruby>!<br/>
Here are some words to help you practice pronunciation. Be sure to look up audio references on something like <a href="https://forvo.com/languages/ja/">Forvo</a>.</p>

<h3>The small tsu</h3> 
<div class="chat">
<p>The small tsu (っ or ッ) represents a <t-r>geminate consonant</t-r>. In plain English, that means you lengthen the consonant that comes after it. For example, <ruby>坂<rt>さか</rt></ruby> vs. <ruby>作家<rt>さっか</rt></ruby>, or <ruby>首長<rt>しゅちょう</rt></ruby> vs. <ruby>出張<rt>しゅっちょう</rt></ruby>.<br/>
<div class="frogR"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_neutral.png"/></div> </div>
When put at the end of a word or sentence, it indicates a <t-r>glottal stop</t-r> (the thing that you do when you say "uh-oh" to separate "uh" and "oh"). You might see an "あっ" as a particularly short expression of surprise.

<h3>Pronouncing youon</h3> 
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogL"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_think.png"/></div>
<p><t-r><ruby>拗音<rt>ようおん</rt></ruby></t-r> are the sounds in Japanese that are written with ゃゅょ (and I guess you can count ァィゥェォ with them too?). Youon are expressed with two kana, but they <t-r>only represent one syllable</t-r>.<br/>
Combinations like しゃ,　きょ, りゅ should be pronounced as one syllable. So <ruby>東京<rt>とうきょう</rt></ruby> is pronounced like "to-kyo", not "to-ki-yo" like English speakers normally say. りゃ, りゅ, りょ are particularly hard for English speakers to learn how to say, so be sure to practice them and look up resources and stuff. Here are some common-ish words that use R-column youon.

<h3>Speaking rhythm in Japanese</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogR"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_neutral.png"/></div>
<p>In English, all words have an inherent stress to them; a certain syllable of the word that you say longer and louder than other syllables in the word.<br/>
In Japanese, words don't have that kind of inherent stress. Every kana (besides when you use small kana to write youon) represents one <t-r>mora</t-r>, and each mora takes up the same amount of time. So, the words <ruby>墓<rt>はか</rt></ruby>, <ruby>破壊<rt>はかい</rt></ruby>, <ruby>発火<rt>はっか</rt></ruby>, and <ruby>発会<rt>はっかい</rt></ruby> are 2, 3, 3, and 4 morae respectively, despite all being 2 syllables.<br/>
This is one of the reasons (aside from properly pronouncing ん) that you can tell にゃ and んや apart, because にゃ is one mora while んや is two.<br/>
I guess you can think of a mora like a <t-r>note in a song</t-r>. It has a specific length depending on the tempo of the song and all that.<br/>
Fun fact: the Japanese word for mora, <ruby>拍<rt>はく</rt></ruby>, means "beat" in a musical context.

<h3>Pitch accent in Japanese</h3>
<div class="chat">
<div class="frogL"> <img src="/img/jp/frog_neutral.png"/></div>
<p>However, Japanese does have a feature something somewhat similar to English stress, which is <t-r>pitch accent</t-r>.<br/>
Pitch accent in Japanese isn't strictly necessary to be understood, but will help you sound more fluent and distinguish homonyms.<br/>
The next lesson will be about pitch accent in a little more detail, but for now I'll drop links to some helpful links about phonology and pitch accent (that are probably going to make up most of the info in my next lesson, honestly).<br/>

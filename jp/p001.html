<p>Hiya! Welcome to SadColor's simple Japanese grammar lessons!
Today, we're gonna be starting with some really basic sentences!</p>

<h3>What constitutes a sentence in Japanese?</h3>
<p>In English, you may know that sentences require a subject and a verb (and object for a transitive verb), and that your clause must form a "complete thought" (with some exceptions).</p>
<div class="reibun">(put some examples here)</div>

<p>Unlike English, Japanese is a much more context-sensitive language. You can have totally valid sentences with just one word.</p>

<h3>Okay, but I wanna make sentences that are longer than one word...</h3>
<p>Japanese is considered a topic-comment language.<br/>
A basic sentence structure is 「subjectはpredicate」, with は being the topic particle.<br/>
＊Note that when used as a particle, は is pronounced わ.</p>

<p>
When we use this sentence structure with a noun or adjective in the predicate, we add です to the end of the sentence (for the time being). <br/>
You can think of it like the English word "be", but I would not recommend sticking to this conception very tightly. I'll explain more about it in a future lesson, but for now, please remember to use it.<br/>
It's polite.

<p>
Using this sentence structure with a verb can be a little tricky. Depending on the verb, the sentence will come out sounding unnatural.<br/>
Many intransitive verbs like <ruby>始<rt>はじ</rt></ruby>まる, <ruby>開<rt>あ</rt></ruby>く, or つく refer back to the subject of the verb, and so take the particle が.<br/>
Again, I'll have to explain more in a future lesson, so just remember to check how your verbs are used in example sentences!

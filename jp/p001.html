<p>Hiya! Welcome to SadColor's simple Japanese grammar lessons!
Today, we're gonna be starting with some really basic sentences!</p>

<h3>What constitutes a sentence in Japanese?</h3>
<p>In English, you may know that sentences require a subject and a verb (and object for a transitive verb), and that your clause must form a "complete thought" (with some exceptions).</p>
<p>Unlike English, Japanese is a much more context-sensitive language. You can have totally valid sentences with just one word.</p>
<p>(put some examples here)</p>

<h3>Okay, but I wanna make sentences that are longer than one word…</h3>
<p>Japanese is considered a topic-comment language. A basic sentence structure is 「subjectはpredicate」, with は being the topic particle.
＊Note that when used as a particle, は is pronounced わ.</p>
    
<p>(put some examples here)</p>
    
<p>
When we use this sentence structure with a noun or adjective in the predicate, we add です to the end of the sentence (for the time being). You can think of it like the English word "be", but I would not recommend sticking to this conception very tightly. I'll explain more about it in a future lesson, but for now, please remember to use it. It's polite.

<p>
Using this sentence structure with a verb can be a little tricky. If you use some verbs with this structure, the sentence will end up sounding unnatural. This is actually dependent on what verb is being used. Many intransitive verbs like <ruby>始<rt>はじ</rt></ruby>まる, <ruby>開<rt>あ</rt></ruby>く, or つく refer back to the subject of the verb, and so take the particle が. Again, I'll have to explain more in a future lesson, so just remember to check how your verbs are used in example sentences!

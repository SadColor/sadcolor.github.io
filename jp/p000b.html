<p>Hiya! This time we're gonna be discussing <t-r>pitch accent</t-r> in Japanese.<br/>
I don't think it's as scary as it sounds, but also it's a little confusing. Let's dive in.
{{ triL }}
</p></div>

<h3>A couple useful resources</h3>
<div class="chat">
{{ imgR }} {{ frog_t }} </div>
Before I begin, I would like to link a couple resources here so I don't have to keep doing so every section.<br/>
<a href="https://forvo.com/languages/ja/">Forvo</a> is a website where you can listen to people pronounce words. It's pretty useful for hearing words from Japanese speakers.<br/>
A very useful resource is <a href="http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/phrasing/index">Prosody Tutor Suzuki-kun</a>. This site can break down words and sentences and analyze their pitch, showing you graphs of the pitch and where accents fall. This is pretty useful when you need a little more than simple words.
It's the same website, but the <a href="http://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/eng/pages/home">Online Japanese Accent Dictionary (OJAD)</a> is a dictionary specifically for pitch accents. It also has male and female voices reading words with the proper intonations. Handy!<br/>
If you use Jisho, there are Firefox and Chrome extensions to add pitch accents to words based on the OJAD, but it can mess up sometimes on words with multiple readings.<br/>
I'll also relink this <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-pronunciation/">Tofugu article</a> about Japanese pronunciation since there is a section at the end covering pitch accent within words and during sentences.<br/>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/oEjxhWU.jpg">Here</a> is a chart illustrating the pitch accent patterns, with the number indicating which mora the downstep occurs on.<br/>
And a final note: pitch accent <i>does</i> vary based on region and dialect, but that doesn't mean pitch accent isn't important to sounding natural. If you don't know anything about pitch accent, your pitch isn't gonna sound anything like a dialect of Japan.<br/>
Like everything on this site, the pitch accents in this article will be from <t-r>Standard Japanese</t-r> since that's what I've been learning and it's probably also what you've been learning.

<h3>Pitch accent patterns</h3>
<div class="chat">
{{ imgR }} {{ frog_n }} </div>
In Japanese, words can have a downstep in pitch, or not.<br/>
Whether and where the downstep occurs gives rise to the four pitch accent patterns: <t-r><ruby>平板<rt>へいばん</rt></ruby></t-r> (flat), <t-b><ruby>頭高<rt>あたまだか</rt></ruby></t-b> (head-high), <t-g><ruby>中高<rt>なかだか</rt></ruby></t-g> (middle-high), and <t-y><ruby>尾高<rt>おだか</rt></ruby></t-y> (tail-high).<br/>
Particles don't have an inherent pitch, but instead keep the same pitch as the preceding word.<br/>
Let's start with <t-b>atamadaka</t-b>, because it's different than all the others. <br/>
Atamadaka words start with a high pitch on the first mora, then fall in pitch on the second and stay at the low pitch. In other words, the accent falls on the first mora.<br/>
Here are some examples of atamadaka words. Try listening to native speakers say these words or put them into Suzuki-kun and mimicking the pitch.

<div class="note"><p>
Even one-mora words can be atamadaka.<br/>
Pitch accent isn't strictly contained within the word, so a one-mora word like <ruby>木<rt>き</rt></ruby> will be said on the high pitch, but you can't hear the low pitch until the following word or particle. So for example, if we attach the が particle, the pitch becomes <ruby>木<rt>き</rt></ruby>↘が.<br/>
Actually, I think these can also be called odaka, a pattern we're about to cover.
</p>
{{ triR }}
</div>

<div class="chat">
{{ imgL }} {{ frog_t }} </div>
<p>For the other three patterns, the first mora is a low pitch, followed by a high pitch for the rest of the mora until the downstep.<br/>
<t-r>Heiban</t-r> words make up a little over 50% of Japanese words. In this pattern, there is never a downstep. In this pattern, only the first mora is low, and the rest are high. Note that the pitch rise on heiban words isn't as great as on the other patterns.<br/>
<t-g>Nakadaka</t-g> words have the downstep fall before the end of the word. Therefore, the pattern is a low mora, followed by at least one high mora until the downstep.<br/>
<t-y>Odaka</t-y> words have the downstep fall on the last mora of the word. This means that they sound identical to the <t-r>heiban</t-r> pattern, until you hear a particle or other word come afterwards, when you will hear the pitch drop.<br/>
Here are examples of these three patterns. Try to identify which are which based on where the downstep occurs.

<p>Well, knowing this is all good and well, but if you want to put this knowledge to use, you're gonna have to pay attention when you hear Japanese speech and see how their pitch changes throughout the sentence, and to where pitches change inside individual words.<br/>
<t-r>The key factor is the downstep</t-r>. By listening to a word and the particle that follows, you can class words in to <t-r>heiban</t-r> (no downstep), <t-b>atamadaka</t-b> (downstep after the first mora), <t-g>nakadaka</t-g> (downstep in the middle of the word), or </t-y>odaka</t-y> (downstep after the end of the word).<br/>
To help you start listening for accent, try listening for pitch differences between these similar words.

<h3>Pitch accent of い adjectives and verbs</h3>
<div class="chat">
{{ imgL }} {{ frog_t }} </div>
<p>Pitch accent for い adjectives and verbs are actually simpler, in some sense.<br/>
I think nearly every verb and い adjective, you can classify them as either <t-r>heiban</t-r> or <t-b>not heiban</t-b>. Unfortunately, the where the downstep occurs can change depending on the inflection, <br/>
For <t-r>heiban</t-r> verbs, the a downstep occurs on the ま↘す in the polite form, on the な↘かった in the negative past form, on the え↘ば in the ba form, and the お↘う in the volitional form.<br/>
For </t-b>non-heiban</t-b> verbs, the downstep always occurs on the second-to-last mora (for example, つく↘る). The downstep shifts backwards one mora for the past, negative, negative past, ba-, and te-forms.<br/>
For <t-r>heiban</t-r> adjectives, a downstep is added before the い (or whatever replaces the い in reflections that replace it) in every inflection besides the く (adverbial) form. This also includes when you use です, for example あ↗か↘いです when the normal pitch accent is あ↗かい.<br/>
For </t-b>non-heiban</t-b> adjectives, the downstep will always fall on the mora before the い. You can actually keep the pitch accent the same across all inflections. It's also valid to shift the downstep back one mora just like non-heiban verbs in every inflection besides the polite form.<br/>
You haven't learned any of these inflections for verbs and adjectives, but in the future you can reference this section for the rules.<br/>
I'll put an example verb/adjective for each category just to have a more concrete picture of the pitch accent changing.

<p>Well, that's all I really know about pitch accent for the time being.<br/>
Be sure to get good practice in with it, alright?<br/>
Thanks for reading, and see ya next time!
